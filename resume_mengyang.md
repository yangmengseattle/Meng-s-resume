## Career Accomplishments

I have been receiving high remarks from colleagues since volunteering in Museum of Flight, as scheduler, HR assistant and gallery ambassador. My performance as scheduler and HR assistant shows my patience, sense of order and good ability of learning. I have been providing efficient customer support together with the staff in MOF as a gallery ambassador. 

During my years as an English teacher, many students of mine have got great improvements and more satisfying grades in their school tests, with many topping the list in their school.

I did more than just what was expected by training other teachers, developing teaching materials with *Microsoft Powerpoint* and exercise books and taking part and leading regular teaching seminars and so on.
